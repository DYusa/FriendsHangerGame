# FriendsHangerGame
Very merry easy hanging man game using the lingo from friends to match my recurrent obsession with the smelly cat song!


## Features

- **Friends Themed Words:** The word list includes phrases and characters from *Friends*, such as "How you doin'?", "Smelly Cat", and "We were on a break!".
- **Guessing Logic:** You have to guess the word by inputting letters. If the letter exists in the word, it gets revealed; otherwise, you lose an attempt.
- **Fun Feedback:** The game offers quirky feedback such as "How you doin'?" and "Smelly Cat" to make the experience more entertaining.
- **Game Over Conditions:** You either win by guessing the entire word or lose when you run out of attempts.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DYusa/FriendsHangerGame.git
    ```

2. Open the solution in your preferred C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code).

3. Build and run the project.

## How to Play

1. Upon starting the game, a word (from the *Friends* lingo list) will be selected randomly.
2. You need to guess the word by entering one letter at a time.
3. For each incorrect guess, you will lose one of your 6 attempts.
4. If you guess the word correctly before running out of attempts, you win! If you run out of attempts, the game ends.
5. If not, do not worry.
